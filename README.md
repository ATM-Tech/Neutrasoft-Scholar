# Neutrasoft-Scholar
```diff
- CURRENTLY NON-FUNCTIONAL AS SQL SERVER DATABASE IS NOT ACCESSIBLE OVER THE INTERNET. WILL BE UPDATED SOON
```
This project is (going to be) a full fledged school management software (Like <a href="https://www.skyward.com/">Skyward</a>). During the development of the project, the database access file will be present in the repository, but upon completion of the project it will be removed as the idea is that this file would be added by each school/district that uses it. A full example release build will also be found upon the completion of the project.
You can follow development progress through the commits and active posts on the <a href="https://nuetrasoftscholar.blogspot.com/">Development Blog</a>
